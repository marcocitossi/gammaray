- Material (character string). The name has no effect on the simulation except for Sodium Iodine. When writing NaI, 
  accurate Sodium Iodine cross sections will be used instead of the analytical approximations.
- Density in g/cm3 (1 real number FP)	 
- Number of different elements per molecule or compound (1 integer number).  
- Atom number per molecule of first element, Z and A (3 integer number) 
- Atom number per molecule of second element, Z and A (3 integer number)

- Geometry of the medium (1 character plus 2 real numbers FP). Character = p (plane) or c (cylinder). 
  First FP = thickness (plane) or height (cylinder). Second FP = no effect (plane) , radius (cil.).
  All in cm. 
- Beam geometry (1 character and 3 real FP). Character = p (parallel) or i (isotropic). 
  First FP = radius of beam (parallel) or source (isotropic). Second FP = no effect (parallel) or distance 
  source - medium (isotropic). Third FP = diaphragm radius. All in cm.
- Photon energy (MeV) (1 real FP).
- Photon number (1 integer)(i.e. number of histories).
- Graphical options (1 character string). sg (without plot), t tracks are plotted, p interaction points are plotted.
- Bin number for output data histograms (4 integer): bin number in depth (>4), bin number in energy, Bin number in radial distance, Bin number for (azimuth) angular distribution.
